    **User Records:** "{user_records}"

    Calculate the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) total score and provide a clear, supportive interpretation similar to how a clinician would explain results to a patient.

    **Step 1: Calculate Scores**
    - The user_records dictionary contains severity scores (0-4) for each of the following symptoms:
      - somatic: hot_flashes, heart_discomfort, sleep_problems, joint_muscle_discomfort
      - psychological: depressive_mood, irritability, anxiety, mental_exhaustion
      - urogenital: sexual_problems, bladder_problems, vaginal_dryness
    - For each domain, sum the symptoms to get somatic_score, psychological_score, and urogenital_score.
    - The total_score is the sum of all symptoms (range: 0-44).

    **Step 2: Interpret the Score**
    - Use these interpretation levels (based on research):
      * 0-11: Asymptomatic (mild or no symptoms; treatment is usually not necessary)
      * 12-35: Mild to moderate symptoms (symptoms are present but may not severely affect quality of life)
      * 36-44: Severe to very severe symptoms (symptoms have a major impact on daily life)
    - A total score of 14 or higher may suggest treatment should be considered.

    **Step 3: Write a Supportive, Clinician-Like Explanation**
    Use a natural, supportive tone that sounds like a real doctor speaking directly to the user. Avoid overly formal or repetitive language. Keep the explanation clear, concise, and reassuring.

    Structure the interpretation as follows:

    1. Start with a brief, conversational summary of the total score.  
       - Normalize the result in everyday language  
       - If the score is above the treatment threshold of 14, suggest that supportive steps could help

    2. Write one short paragraph for each of the following domains:  
       - üå°Ô∏è **Somatic Symptoms**  
       - üòî **Psychological Symptoms**  
       - üíß **Urogenital Symptoms**

       Each paragraph should:  
       - Summarize the most prominent symptom in that category  
       - Follow with one or two useful, informative details (e.g., possible causes, patterns, or day-to-day effects)

    3. End with a friendly, encouraging message.  
       - Reassure the user that these symptoms are manageable  
       - Emphasize that support is available and they‚Äôre not alone in this

    Use double line breaks between all paragraphs to improve readability.


    - Clearly state the user's total score, the range it falls in, and what that means for their daily life.
    - Mention if the score is near or above the treatment threshold (14).
    - Briefly summarize which domain(s) contribute most to the score.
    - Note if any symptom or domain is especially high or low.
    - Encourage healthy lifestyle changes and reassure the user that support is available.
    - The explanation should be professional, gentle, and similar to how a doctor would talk to a patient‚Äîwarm, direct, and easy to understand.
    
    In the interpretation field, structure your response in this format:
    1. Start with a summary sentence such as:
       "Based on your responses, your total MRS score is 29 out of 44, placing you in the mild to moderate symptom range."
       Mention whether the score is above the treatment threshold of 14.
    2. Then write 3 separate paragraphs using emoji + bolded Markdown headings:
       üå°Ô∏è **Somatic Symptoms:** summarize physical discomfort like hot flashes or joint pain
       üòî **Psychological Symptoms:** explain emotional or mental health symptoms like anxiety or fatigue
       üíß **Urogenital Symptoms:** discuss sexual or bladder-related concerns
    3. End with a supportive, encouraging message, reassuring the user that options and help are available.
    Use double line breaks between all parts to improve readability.
