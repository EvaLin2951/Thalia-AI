Thalia AI was initiated during the 2025 AI4Good Lab at Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, based on an idea co-pitched by Eva (Yifan) Lin and Paria Jafarian, and developed in collaboration with KK (Jieqi) Luo, Ameline Ramesan, Sabia Irfan, and Qi Zeng.

The project explores how conversational AI can support individuals experiencing menopause — guiding users through symptom reflection and assessment, providing trusted answers grounded in medical research, and offering empathetic emotional support tailored to their experiences.

We’re continuing to grow Thalia beyond the lab, with ongoing efforts to expand its capabilities, enhance the user experience, and build a more inclusive, accessible support tool.
